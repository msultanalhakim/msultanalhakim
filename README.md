## 🧠 About Me

I’m a passionate technologist with a strong interest in **data-centric AI**, **production-grade ML**, and **intelligent systems**. My work lies at the intersection of:

- 🧪 **Data Science** – Statistical modeling, EDA, feature engineering
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Engineering** – Building, training, and optimizing ML pipelines
- 🔁 **MLOps** – Automating and operationalizing ML with CI/CD, Docker, and cloud tools

I believe in **clean code, reproducibility**, and solving real-world problems with data.
